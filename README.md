# Supervised Learning Algorithm for Musical Genre Recognition

Author: Laurens Hoogenboom

This repository was made for a project at the Delft University of Technology, as part of the course "SC42140 Signal Analysis and Learning for Two-Dimensional Systems".
The project concerns wrtiting a supervised learning algorithm for musical genre recognition. The genres are limited to pop, rock, jazz and classical. The training and validation sets were personally constructed from a provided repository of musac samples. 

The music sample repository is open-source and are thus accesible to anyone. In order to incluse the music samples in the repository LFT was used.
