# Supervised Learning Algorithm for Musical Genre Recognition

*Author: Laurens Hoogenboom*

This repository was made for a project at the Delft University of Technology, as part of the course **_SC42140 Signal Analysis and Learning for Two-Dimensional Systems_**.

The project concerns wrtiting a supervised learning algorithm for musical genre recognition. The genres are limited to `pop`, `rock`, `jazz` and `classical`. The training and validation sets were personally constructed from a provided repository of music samples.

In order to improve efficiency of the system that maples will first be filtered, and then fed to the learning algorithm. This filtering will be done using prior knowledge, and knowledge from this course. THe Machine learning will be done relying solely on knowledge obtained throughout this course.

The music sample repository is open-source and are thus accesible to anyone. In order to incluse the music samples in the repository LFT was used.
